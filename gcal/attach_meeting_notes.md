# Attaching meeting notes to a Google Calendar Event

There are multiple ways to attach documents but only one way to attach 'meeting notes'
so that they are listed under the 'Meeting Notes' field.

For new events you can click on the "Take Meeting Notes" link but if you already have a
doc that you want to use for meeting notes you can follow the steps listed here:

[Add meeting notes to events from Google Docs](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/11324079)

Copied below for convenience:

1. Make sure you are the event organiser (only the organiser can do this)
2. In the doc, enter ‘@’.
3. In the pop-up menu, click Meeting notes.
4. Search for an event.
5. Select an event. Meeting notes are pre-populated with event details but aren't attached to the event.
    * If you’re the meeting organiser: A pop-up prompts you to share and attach the document to your event. To give access, click Share & attach.
    * If you’re not the meeting organiser: A pop-up prompts you to share the document. To give access, click Share. The document doesn't attach to the event.
